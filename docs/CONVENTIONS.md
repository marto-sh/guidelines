# Rust Conventions

This document provides an overview of the Rust conventions we follow. These conventions are designed to help us write code that is safe, predictable, and easy to maintain, with a special focus on making the codebase accessible to AI agents.

Our core philosophy is that **AI agents are first-class citizens in the development process**. You can read more about this in our [philosophy document](./conventions/philosophy.md).

## Convention Documents

The conventions are broken down into the following documents:

-   [**Philosophy**](./conventions/philosophy.md): The core principles that guide our conventions.
-   [**Automated Conventions**](./conventions/automated-conventions.md): How we use `clippy` to enforce conventions automatically.
-   [**Manual Conventions**](./conventions/manual-conventions.md): The few conventions that we need to enforce manually.
-   [**Testing Strategy**](./conventions/testing-strategy.md): How we write unit and integration tests.
-   [**Strategic Artifact Organization**](./conventions/strategic-artifact-organization.md): Where to find key design documents.
-   [**Commit Messages**](./conventions/commit-messages.md): How to format commit messages using Conventional Commits.
-   [**When to Deviate**](./conventions/when-to-deviate.md): When it's okay to break the rules.
