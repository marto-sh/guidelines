# Architecture Overview

## 1. Subdomain Classification

*This section classifies the different parts of the system to help focus development effort on what's most important.*

### Core Domain
> The heart of the business and what gives it a competitive advantage. This is where most of the custom software development effort should be focused.
> - **[Subdomain Name]**: [Brief Description]

### Supporting Subdomains
> Related to what the business does, but not a differentiator. These can be complex, but they don't provide a competitive edge. Can be built in-house or outsourced.
> - **[Subdomain Name]**: [Brief Description]

### Generic Subdomains
> "Solved problems" that are not specific to the business. Always prefer buying an off-the-shelf solution for these.
> - **[Subdomain Name]**: [Brief Description, e.g., Authentication, Notifications]
