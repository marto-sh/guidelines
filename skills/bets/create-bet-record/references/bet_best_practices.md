# Best Practices for Creating Bet Records

## Why Bets Matter

Bet Records serve several purposes:

1. **Accountability:** Force explicit commitment to beliefs, preventing revisionist history
2. **Clarity:** Transform vague intuitions into testable predictions
3. **Learning:** Create feedback loops for calibrating future beliefs
4. **Alignment:** Make foundational assumptions visible so teams can challenge them

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Vague Criteria

**Bad:** "AI will be really good at coding"
**Good:** "AI coding assistants will achieve >90% pass rate on HumanEval benchmark"

Vague criteria allow goalpost moving. If "really good" isn't defined, you can always claim success or failure based on interpretation.

### 2. Asymmetric Evaluation

**Bad:**
- Right when: "Evidence emerges that X is better"
- Wrong when: "Never"

Both success and failure conditions must be specific. If there's no way to be wrong, it's not a real bet.

### 3. Unfalsifiable Beliefs

**Bad:** "Eventually, AI will surpass human intelligence"
**Good:** "By December 2027, an AI system will win the IMO gold medal"

"Eventually" is unfalsifiable. Every bet needs a concrete timeline.

### 4. Escape Hatches

**Bad:** "AI will outperform humans, unless major setbacks occur"
**Good:** "AI will outperform humans on [specific benchmark] regardless of circumstances"

Escape hatches undermine accountability. A bet should commit to an outcome.

### 5. Measuring the Wrong Thing

Ensure your criteria actually capture what you believe, not a proxy that could diverge:

**Bad:** "AI companies will be successful" (measured by stock price)
**Good:** "AI will generate >$100B in direct enterprise value" (measured by revenue)

Stock prices can be disconnected from underlying reality.

## Characteristics of Good Bets

### Specific and Measurable

- Uses concrete numbers, dates, and metrics
- Two independent observers would agree on the outcome
- No ambiguous terms without definitions

### Time-Bounded

- Has a specific evaluation date
- Allows for interim check-ins
- Timeline is realistic given current trends

### Meaningful

- Affects real decisions if true
- Has practical implications documented
- Worth the effort to track

### Intellectually Honest

- Acknowledges uncertainty
- Documents counter-arguments
- Fairly represents alternative views

### Falsifiable

- Clear conditions for being wrong
- No built-in escape hatches
- Wrongness criteria as specific as rightness criteria

## Calibration Tips

### Use Reference Classes

Look for similar past predictions:
- How accurate were predictions about the internet in 1995?
- How did self-driving car timelines compare to reality?
- What's the base rate for technology predictions being right?

### Consider Inside vs Outside View

- **Inside view:** Your specific reasoning about this case
- **Outside view:** What typically happens in similar situations

Outside view often provides better calibration, especially for novel predictions.

### Adjust for Optimism Bias

Most people are systematically overconfident about:
- How quickly technology will advance
- How smoothly adoption will proceed
- How few obstacles will emerge

Consider explicitly adjusting timelines upward.

### State Confidence Levels

If possible, assign probabilities:
- "70% confident this will happen"
- This creates better feedback for calibration

## Review and Update Protocol

### During Review

1. Check current evidence against criteria
2. Note any developments that affect confidence
3. Do NOT modify frozen evaluation criteria
4. If views have fundamentally changed, create a superseding bet

### At Evaluation Time

1. Assess outcome against original criteria only
2. Mark status as "right" or "wrong"
3. Write a brief post-mortem:
   - If right: What did you get right? Was it for the right reasons?
   - If wrong: What did you miss? What would you do differently?
4. Extract lessons for future bets

### Superseding Bets

When beliefs evolve significantly:
1. Create a new bet that supersedes the old one
2. Link to the original bet
3. Explain why your thinking changed
4. The original bet remains and will still be evaluated

This preserves intellectual history while allowing beliefs to evolve.
